# Hello World!

Hello there! This is my first blog ever lol. Iâ€™ve always wanted to share my thoughts, experience, projects, etc. so I decided to add blogging in my personal website. 

## What to Expect?
Here, I'll share insights and updates about Software Development, Machine Learning, and even the occasional post about personal stuff. I hope my posts will be insightful and engaging.


Stay tuned for posts about Software Developement and Machine Learning! Thanks for stopping by. ðŸ˜Š
